									<h3>Is the application fee refundable?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Once students receive their acceptance letter, a down payment of 2000 USD/€ must be done to secure the place. The remaining part of the tuition fees might be paid either in one installment or two installments.

The 2000 USD or € confirmation fee is non-refundable. The rest of tuition fees may be refunded if the student notifies his/her withdrawal before the start of the course. Fab Academy reserves the right to cancel or postpone the Diploma course due to low number of enrolled students in each lab. In case of cancellation of the Diploma course in specific locations, the full tuition will be refunded without any type of additional compensations. In case of postponement the tuition fee will be refunded to students that applied for it.

									<h3>Is it a University Master or Post degree? Does it has University credits?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication Program directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything. There is no global accreditation for these skills. Instead, each student builds a portfolio that documents their mastery of them individually, and their integration. The Fab Diploma is awarded by the Fab Academy. It has no institutional connection with MIT (and none should be claimed), but a number of the participating sites offer it overlaid with their local accreditation. It recognizes readiness to work in, and establish, a fab lab. The Fab Diploma has led to students obtaining employment, investment, admission, and recognition.
