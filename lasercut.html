								The Fab Academy teaches principles and applications of digital fabrication. It was developed to teach hands-on skills in fab labs, which began as an outreach project from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms, and has grown into a global network of more than 500 labs.Fab Academy instruction is based on MIT’s popular rapid-prototyping course How To Make (almost) Anything, both taught by Prof. Neil Gershenfeld. It offers a distributed rather than distance educational model: students learn in local workgroups, with peers, mentors, and machines, which are then connected globally by content sharing and video for interactive classes. The individual labs are supported and supervised regionally by supernode sites with more advanced capabilities, expertise, and inventories.</p>

								<p>
									Most of our students are trying Grasshopper as a parametric modeling tool, others try to use 123d Make. Theirs first prototype is made in normal 3mm corrugated cardboard, after they fully functional prototype they try depending on theirs personal preferences with plywood, acryl and some of them try to use also the metal laser cutter.
							What results/designs we will see when they finish theirs cuts?

									<h3>How It Works</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Fab Academy is a distributed educational model providing a unique educational experience.

								Each Fab Lab that participates in the Fab Academy program is part of a global Fab Lab / Fab Academy network. These Fab Labs are Nodes that offer the Fab Academy program.
								Students view and participate in global lectures broadcasted every Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST. 
								The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. In addition to the lectures, there are 2 / 3 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects. Each Fab Lab will establish the schedule for these Lab days.
								Fab Academy faculty, who are leaders in their respective fields, provide global video lectures, supervise academic content, and guide research.
								Hands-on instruction in the labs is provided by instructors who supervise and evaluate Certificates, develop and disseminate instructional material, and assist with projects.
